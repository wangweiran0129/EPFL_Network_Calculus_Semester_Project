Compilation instructions:
-------------------------

The archive contains the source code and the Eclipse project files
required to build the binary. If you use Eclipse, just import the
existing project into your workspace.

If you prefer to compile the source manually, you can find a makefile
into the Release folder.

Check out the scenarios/ folder for some example configuration files
representing both nested and non-nested tandems.
